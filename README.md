# HyperVClusteredEnvBuildout
A fresh new Hyper-V box and a fresh new clustered environment: 90% Done
The HyperVClusteredEnvBuildout allows you to;
1) Build your Hyper-V server with DSC (Desired State Configuration) to ensure configuration and no drift to your servers
2) Build a new Hyper-V VM if you'd like.
3) Create a new server cluster between 2 or multiple nodes
4) Create a new iSCSI config between your cluster and your iSCSI LUN.
